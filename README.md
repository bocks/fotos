# fotos

## Project Overview

Most people have hundreds of photos stored in countless websites. It takes a significant amount of time to scroll through all of your photos to find your best memories from years ago. With Foto Time, we give you access to your memories. Choose a time range and we'll pick out a few photos from that time period. All of your photo stories are saved with Foto Time so you can review them anytime.
